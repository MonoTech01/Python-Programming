print the variable my_string using an f-string print()

# 4

print the first five characters of my_string using slicing

print the last character

# 5

Without using the Internet, calculator, or Python. What is the result of the expression?

# 6

The values “warm”, and ”cold” need to be evaluated. 

print I can go outside if it is warm

or print I’ll stay home if it cold

ode the above in Python
